    <p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within
        the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by
        JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), 
        followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.</p>
    <div id="seconddiv" class="blue bg-blue">Second</div>
    <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. 
        However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class. 
        The class attribute is part of the Global Attributes, and can be used on any HTML element.</p>
